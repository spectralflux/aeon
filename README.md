# Aeon - Programming Language

A small, static, python-ish interpreted language.

The inspiration for building this in Java comes from "jlox", the java interpreter for the Lox
language, which is the subject of the wonderful book by Bob Nystr√∂m called Crafting Interpreters 
(https://craftinginterpreters.com/). The idea is that its easier to work out language kinks in a simpler
interpreted form than to do the hard work of implementing "on metal" with your own low level interpreter.
