# Language TODO list

A list of broad features that need to be added,
in order:

1. Add functions DONE
2. Add 'print' native function DONE
3. Get interpreter working DONE
4. Interpreter has many empty visitor methods, fill these in
4. Add classes
5. Add class inheritance model

BUGS
* Resolver not resolving defined function into scope, so interpreter barfs thinking identifier
    doesn't exist.
