# Language TODO list

A list of broad features that need to be added,
in order:

1. Add functions DONE
2. Add 'print' native function DONE
3. Get interpreter working DONE
4. Variable assignment and variable use (let vs var also)
5. Interpreter has many empty visitor methods, fill these in
6. static typing ('as' keyword, come up with nice syntax for static return indication)
7. Add classes
8. Add class inheritance model
